#### MICRO-FICTION


_An example of my writing; only 50 words (my sweet spot):_

> **REDSHIRT**
>
> &ldquo;Jonas, report to transporter room three.&rdquo; He dreaded those words. Would his family miss him? Did he have family? What was his full name? So many unanswered questions. He would miss his undeveloped character support group. Donuts tonight, damn. He grabbed his phaser. Duty called. He was a redshirt after-all.

_And if you're now asking "Wait, what's a Redshirt?"... [Redshirt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirt_(stock_character))_
